* 8:00 Research Spot API
* 9:00 trying to understand Spotify URI to log into my account.  My account was created with Facebook login.  So how do I use that in an API?
* spotify console https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications/0d33cf4dd1554d0ca36a41cca75f7454
* 9:30 initial rails file, naming problem, need to start over
* 10:00 rusty start on rails, keep messing up naming conventions and having to teardown and restart.

* 10:30 started setup of files and diverted to prioritize making api connect in postman before anything else.
* 11:30 SUCCESSFUL postman connection to MY OWN playlists of my profile including playlists authored and shared from others.  YAYYYYYYYY!
